Point Out 
=========

## Description

'Point out' is my first simple webapp to report issues that you face on a daily basis.

## Gems
I have used (so far) only very basic gems:
- pg  
- bcrypt-ruby
- twitter-bootstrap-rails
- awesome-print

## Features :)

+ login screen (logging using simple bcrypt gem)
+ all issues section (all opened system issues)
+ mine issues section (where you can see issues connected with yourself)
+ two types of users (User & PM)

## TODO

- create db field (:assigned_to), which will be assigned by PM to the partucular user,
- enhance 'mine issues' view, that every user can see following sections: opened issues, my solutions, other solutions
- let users authenticate accounts using FB, GH, GMAIL, ...
- darken the whole app
- and so on...

## Version
Alpha :)
